# Building-Bank-Loan-Risk-Classifier

It is a project completed by a team of 3 for STAT526 Advanced Statistical Methodology

In the project, we

1. Used Logistic Regression (binomial) to study between loan risk and custom information (20+ features, 1000 training samples).
2. Applied stepwise regression and backward elimination and validated the model using 500 customer observations.
3. Applied Pearson Chi Square tests to analyze pairwise independence between all features.
